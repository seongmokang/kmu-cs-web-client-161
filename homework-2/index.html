    <h1>Understanding CSS Concepts</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Describe difference between HTML and CSS with respect to the <em>roles</em> they take in a web page? (5 point)</li>
      <div>Answer:<br>
       HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages.<br>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.
      </div><br>
      <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet, what does <em>Cascading</em> means? (5 point)</li><div>Answer:<br>"Cascading" in this context means that more than one stylesheet rule could apply to a particular piece of HTML.</div><br>
      <li>List <em>three different methods</em> to use CSS with a HTML document and write a brief decription how to use it(5 point)</li>
      <div>Answer:<br>
        External style sheet : create a style.css file and write some style values after that link the styles.css file in a HTML file<br>
        Internal style sheet : inserted within header <q>style</q>tag<br>
        Inline style : A style can be added for a single element within a start tag<br>
      </div><br>
      <li>For the three different methods discussed at the previous problem, describe pros and cons (advantage and disadvantages) of them comparing with others(10 point)</li>
      <div>Answer:<br>
        "external CSS" <br>
         pros -> it can share a CSS file across diffenrt HTML pages, and reduce file size. so there is lower network overhead than others<br>
         cons -> it restricts my freedom for example layout size, grid width, and others. and it is not easy to add extra code.<br>
         "Internal CSS" <br>
         pros -> easier to work as style and HTML is in a single file<br>
         cons -> if same style applies to multiple HTML documents the style has to be copied and its file size can be larger than others.<br>
         "Inline CSS"<br>
         pros -> it is easier for test than others.<br>
         cons -> it can be overriding bacause it has the highest priority. I have to apply for every elements.
      </div><br>
      <li>When we want to set font style using CSS, we can set generic family and font family. What are the difference between them?(5 point) Which one is recommended to state as a last option to show in a web-page? (5 point)</li>
      <div>Answer:<br>
        generic family is a set of fonts with similar look. it has to be used as a last fallback mechanism.<br>however font family is under generic family, it has more fine grained set of fonts.<br>
        Font-family is recommended to state as a last option to show in a web-page.<br>
      </div><br>
      <li>When we want to control space of an element, we can use <em>padding</em> and <em>margin</em>. What are the difference between them?(5 point)</li>
      <div>Answer:<br>
        padding is the space between the content and the border, whereas margin is the space outside the border.
      </div><br>
      <li>When we set font size using CSS, we can use units of <em>em, %, px</em>. How are they different? (5 point)</li>
      <div>Answer:<br>
        "px" is setting the text size with pixels gives you full control over the text size.<br>
        "1em" is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.<br>
        "%" is the solution that works in all browser. it is ratio from the default size.<br>
      </div><br>
      <li>There are four ways to set conditional property for a sequence of elements (parent-child, siblings) - we called it as <em>Combinator</em> in the class. Describe the name of the four combinators with brief descripton and give a short example (10 point)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>descendant selector (space)<br>
        - the style applies only to parent-child relation in the document<br>
        ex) selectorA selectorB{ }<br>
        <li>child selector (>)<br>
        - applies to only immediate children<br>
        ex) selectorA > selectorB{ }<br>
        <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)<br>
        - applies to elements that are only adjacent sibling element<br>
        ex) selectorA + selectorB{ }<br>
        <li>general sibling selector (~)<br>
        - applies to all other sibling elements<br>
        ex) selectorA ~ selectorB{ }<br>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <h1>Make an aesthetic web page using CSS</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <a href="border-shorthand.html">border-shorthand.html</a> and fill the <em>border-single</em> class to have the second div element to have the same effect with the first div element. <strong>You can use only one element in the border-single CSS class</strong>. (2 point) </li>
      <li>Open <a href="last-paragraph.html">last-paragraph.html</a> and fill in the <i>style</i> tag to make only the last paragraph (the third one) to have the following effects(5 point)
        <ul>
          <li>Make the font color as red</li>
          <li>Make the font to be bold</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Using <a href="position.html">position.html</a> file, add style elements to make the paragraphs shown like below. (8 points)
      <img style="display:block;width:50%;" src="position.png">
      <br>Hints
      <ul>
        <li>For the first and fourth paragraph, you have to use fixed position</li>
        <li>For the second paragraph, you have to specify margin to avoid overlapping with the top most paragraph</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Using <a href="table.html">table.html</a> file, modify the table to be shown like below. You must follow the rules below.(15 point)
      <img style="display:block;width:80%;" src="table-sample.png">
      <ul>
        <li>Specific color, font, border style does not matter unless it is specifically mentioned below</li>
        <li>Create an external css file (file name: table.css) and link it in the table.html</li>
        <li>The table header elements have to be left aligned</li>
        <li>The td elements have to be center aligned</li>
        <li>When a mouse pointer is over a row, it has to change color including the table header row (green, ...)</li>
        <li>Make every 2nd line (line number 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...) to have darker color</li>
        <li>You do not need to set the background-color for td and th elements. If you  do so, making hover to change color will be harder as the solution is not covered in the class</li>
        <li>Recommends to try various colors - <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">Color Link</a>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>

      <ul>
        <li>For the navigation bar background, you have to use <q>nav-bar-bg.png</q> file</li>
        <li>For the navigation bar, you have to set the width as 100% and the height as 140px</li>
        <li>The fonts size of characters is 20px, the color is #483535, and the font is Nanum Gothic</li>
        <li>When the mouse point is over the link, it should show only one <q>hover-icon.png</q> file in a default location(left top) - you don't have to worry about making it same as the original site</li>
